## Projects

|â„–| Title | Project description | Tools used |
|:---|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
|19  |[Graduate project. Telecom. Customer churn forecasting](19_graduate_project_telecom_customer_churn/graduate_project_telecom_customer_churn.ipynb)|It is necessary to learn how to accurately predict the churn of customers of a telecom operator. This will allow you to offer promotional codes and bonuses in a timely manner and retain the client|`catboost` `lightgbm` `pytorch` `sklearn` `seaborn` `matplotlib` `pandas` `sqlalchemy`|
|18  |[Computer vision. Age recognition by photo](18_computer_vision_age_recognition_by_photo/computer_vision_age_recognition_by_photo.ipynb)|In order for a chain supermarket to check the integrity of sellers and make targeted offers to its customers, it is necessary to build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph|`Keras` `tensorflow` `Adam` `ResNet50` `ImageDataGenerator` `seaborn` `PIL` `pandas` `matplotlib` `numpy`|
|17  |[NLP. Determination of the toxicity of comments](17_natural_language_processing/natural_language_processing.ipynb)|The store needs a tool that will look for toxic comments and submit them for moderation. To do this, it is necessary to train the model to classify comments into positive and negative ones|`BERT` `spacy` `SVC` `pymystem3` `re` `sklearn` `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib`|
|16  |[Time series. The number of taxi orders for the next hour forecasting](16_time_series/time_series.ipynb)|To attract more drivers during the peak period, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour|`TimeSeriesSplit` `catboost` `lightgbm` `statsmodels` `sklearn` `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `math` `time`|
|15  |[Module project. Car accident forecasting](15_module_project_car_accident_forecasting/car_accident_forecasting.ipynb)|It is necessary to create a system that could assess the risk of an accident along the chosen route. Risk is the probability of an accident with any damage to the vehicle.|`sqlalchemy` `catboost` `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `sklearn` `math`|
|14  |[Determining star temperature](14_determining_star_temperature/determining_star_temperature.ipynb)|Using a neural network, we need to determine the temperature on the surface of the discovered stars based on the astronomical characteristics|`pytorch` `scipy` `matplotlib` `pandas` `numpy` `sklearn`|
|13  |[SQL practice](13_sql_practice/sql_practice.ipynb)|Practice in SQL queries. Subqueries, window functions, results visualization|`SQL` `PostgreSQL` `sqlalchemy` `matplotlib` `pandas` `seaborn`|
|12  |[Determining cars cost](12_determining_cars_cost/determining_cars_cost.ipynb)|It is necessary to build a model to determine the cost of the car, taking into account the limitations indicated by the customer|`catboost` `lightgbm` `sklearn` `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `math` `time`|
|11  |[Linear algebra](11_linear_algebra/linear_algebra.ipynb)|We need to develop a data transformation method that makes it difficult to recover personal information. Justify the correctness of his work.|`sklearn` `pandas` `numpy`|
|10  |[Housing cost forecasting](10_housing_cost_forecasting/housing_cost_forecasting.ipynb)|Given California housing data, we need to predict the median value of a home in a residential area.|`Spark` `StringIndexer` `VectorAssembler` `OneHotEncoder`|
|9   |[Module project. Churn forecasting and payback calculation](09_module_project_churn_forecasting_and_payback_calculation/churn_forecasting_and_payback_calculation.ipynb)|We need to train a model that predicts the cancellation of a hotel room booking. If the model shows that the booking will be cancelled, then the client is asked to make a deposit. It is also necessary to calculate payback|`sklearn` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `pandas` `numpy`|
|8   |[Choosing a location for an oil well](08_machine_learning_for_business/machine_learning_for_business.ipynb)|An oil company needs to decide where to drill a new well. To do this, it is necessary to build a model to determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit|`sklearn` `scipy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `pandas` `numpy`|
|7   |[Customer churn forecasting](07_customer_churn_forecasting/customer_churn_forecasting.ipynb)|We need to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not|`sklearn` `pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib`|
|6   |[Tariff recommendations for current customers](06_machine_learning_intro/machine_learning_intro.ipynb)|It is necessary to train a model that can analyze the behavior of customers who have not changed tariff plans for a long time and offer users a new tariff that meets their preferences|`sklearn` `pandas`|
|5   |[Determination of a prospective tariff for a telecom company](05_statistical_data_analysis/statistical_data_analysis.ipynb)|The purpose of the project is to analyze how customers use cellular communications and draw a conclusion - which of the tariffs offered by the telecom operator brings more money in order to adjust the advertising budget|`scipy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `pandas` `numpy` `math`|
|4   |[Module project. Film distribution research](04_module_project_film_distribution_research/film_distribution_research.ipynb)|In this research, we study the Russian film distribution market and identify current trends, as well as the dependence of the rating on the financial support of the Ministry of Culture|`scipy` `pandas` `numpy` `seaborn` `math`|
|3   |[Research of apartments for sale ads](03_exploratory_data_analysis/exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb)|On the basis of the archive of advertisements for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring cities, conduct an EDA. The goal is to determine the parameters in order to learn how to determine the market value of real estate in the future|`matplotlib` `seaborn` `pandas` `numpy` `math`|
