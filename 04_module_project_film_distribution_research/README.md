# Russian film distribution research

## Description of the project

The customer of this research is the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation.
You need to study the Russian film distribution market and identify current trends. Pay attention to films that have received government support. Try to answer the question of how interesting such films are to the viewer.
You will work with data published on the open data portal of the Ministry of Culture. The data set contains information about distribution certificates, box office and government support for films, as well as information from the KinoPoisk website.
