# SQL practice

## Description of the project

In this project, we need to write some SQL queries in Jupiter Notebook.

The necessary data is located in the tables of the `stackoverflow` schema. We need to connect to the database using SQLAlchemy.

The sample code for connecting to the database and uploading the results is in this notebook.

Some tasks include additional questions â€” they need to be answered.
In addition, some of the questions can be answered in text, and for some you will need visualization.
The result of the request can be uploaded to a dataframe.

We can use any appropriate field names in your queries.


## Tools used

`sqlalchemy` `matplotlib` `pandas` `seaborn`
