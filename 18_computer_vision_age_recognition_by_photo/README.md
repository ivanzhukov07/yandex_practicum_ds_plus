# Age recognition by photo

## Description of the project

A chain supermarket is introducing a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:

Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.

It is necessary to build a model that can determine the approximate age of a person from a photo.
