    "# Research of apartments for sale ads\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of the archive of advertisements for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring cities for several years, you need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. The first task is to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity. For each apartment for sale, two types of data are available. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically on the basis of cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and reservoir.\n",
